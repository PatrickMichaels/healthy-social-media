    "Below you can see how this function changes with time, using different parameters.    \n",
    "The $\\alpha$ parameter changes the maximum size of that freq takes, a higher $\\alpha$ gives us a higher ceiling to reach, meaning more end points appearing, a lower $\\alpha$ would reduce the maximum end points showing up, making for a potentially less intrusive experience. It also has a small impact on the rate of change.  \n",
    "The $\\beta$ parameter changes the how quickly the function reaches a higher value, with some effect on the ceiling, but majority of the impact being on rate of change. If a developer wanted a more senstive model to time with a more rapid change then a higher $\\beta$ value could be used. If they wanted it to be less sensisitive then a small value would be used, this would likely coencide with using seconds as the measurement of time.  \n",
    "So if time was measured in seconds but you wanted a more delayed change to the value of frequency, changing $\\beta$ to a low value would achieve this, but they may wish to increase $\\alpha$ to counteract the changes to the ceiling value of the freq that $\\beta has caused$.  \n",
    "Choosing the ideal $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ values for a site will be highly dependent on the platform and the audience that platform is trying to serve, as well as how intrusive they end points can be tolerated being.    \n"
